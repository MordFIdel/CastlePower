# PowerCastle
A Power manager and UPS for IoT projects<br/><br/>A smart power manager and UPS board for IoT project developers with bunch of smart features.<br/>There are many power converter boards in the market but it was hard to find one with all the needed<br/> power management functions in one place.<br/><br/>After years of having to buy power supplies for our boards, sensors, bus, mcu and non-standard<br/>requirements, each one tailored to a specific need, we decided to finally end this struggle<br/>by providing a one-stop solution. PowerCastle features converters, UPS and smart controls for any power supply need.<br/>PowerCastle provides "power in the loop" used for firmware update without power interuuption.<br/><br/>
